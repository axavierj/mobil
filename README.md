### Folder Structure

The project follows a well-organized folder structure to maintain code readability and scalability:

```
mobil/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── screens/
│   ├── navigation/
│   ├── redux/
│   ├── services/
│   ├── utils/
│   └── App.js
├── assets/
├── .gitignore
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

The `src` directory contains the main source code of the application, divided into different folders based on their functionality. The `components` folder holds reusable UI components, while the `screens` folder contains the different screens of the app. The `navigation` folder handles the app's navigation logic.

The `redux` folder contains the Redux store, actions, and reducers for managing the application's state. The `services` folder includes modules for interacting with external services like Firebase. The `utils` folder contains utility functions and helper classes.

The `assets` directory is used for storing static assets such as images, fonts, and icons. The `.gitignore` file specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git. The `package.json` file lists the project's dependencies and scripts. Finally, the `README.md` file provides an overview of the project and its purpose.

This well-structured folder organization helps maintain a clean and maintainable codebase, making it easier for developers to collaborate and extend the application's functionality.
